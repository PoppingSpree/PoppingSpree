- 👋 Hi, I’m @PoppingSpree. You may call me "Ann", "Lumi", or "Dazl".
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty Glowy Lights, Squishy Toys, Cartoons, and sometimes Guitars.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MelonLoader, SGDK, C, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Starbuster or Freedom Planet 2 mods.
- 🎮 I dabble in videogames, but it's not my favorite thing.
